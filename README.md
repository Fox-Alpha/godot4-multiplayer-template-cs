# Godot 4 Multiplayer Template
This multiplayer template includes the impmenentation of:

- Client Side Prediction
- Entity Interpolation
- Clock Synchronization
- A few other multiplayer systems

You can use it to speed up your developing process, it is based on the client/auth server model.
There are some improvements still left to do, but it works fine for real time multiplayer games.

## Usage
You will need Godot 4.X and C# with at least Net6

## What it is
This example demonstrates how to implement a client-server architecture in Godot using the Godot networking API, this can work as a base for a proper game or just to learn how this techniques can be implemented. I did not use RPC calls, I sent packed bytes manually over the network.
